About
------
Hello! I am a student at INSA Lyon and an apprentice at Alouette AI as an AI/ML Engineer.

Previously, I completed a BUT Informatique (Computer Science Bachelor) at IUT de La Rochelle, including 2 years as an apprentice at [Groupe Covéa](https://www.covea.com/fr), where I spent my first year as a Data Engineer within the group's Big Data platform, and a second year working as an MLOps engineer on the Azure and Databricks platform dedicated to Data Science.  

Passionate about computer science since high school, I have been particularly interested in AI and Data for over 2 years now. I have also had the opportunity to participate in numerous [programming competitions](#programming-competitions) mainly focused on algorithms but not only, as I remain above all curious and enthusiastic about various aspects of computer science.

I sometimes share my adventures and projects through posts on the [blog](https://nirs123.github.io/blog/), and recently I have also been giving [conferences](#conferences) on topics that I am passionate about and enjoy sharing.
